* [ ] Predictive safety (ML-based risk assessment)
* [ ] Safety profiles (per-org, per-repo-type)

=== v1.4.0 - Integration & Automation
* [ ] Git hooks for auto-operations
* [ ] CI/CD integration plugins
* [ ] Webhook support
* [ ] REST API for remote operations

=== v2.0.0 - Advanced Features
* [ ] Distributed execution (across machines)

== Long-term Vision

repo-batcher aims to be the **standard tool for managing repositories at scale** with:

1. **Formal Correctness**: Every operation proven safe before execution
2. **Maximum Performance**: Parallel execution optimized for mass operations
3. **Complete Safety**: Multi-layer protection preventing accidents
4. **Universal Applicability**: Works across forges, languages, and workflows
5. **Community-Driven**: Extensible operation system for custom needs
