*Scaffoldia* is a developer-centred, modular, and community-driven repo scaffolding engine. 
It helps developers, educators, and teams generate idiomatic, validated, and narratable project structures across languages, tools, and a range of project themes and audience stances.

== 🔧 What It Does

- 🧠 Validates language/tool templates via a Haskell-powered registry
- 🧩 Composes repo scaffolds using Nickel
- 🧪 Infers missing structure with MiniKanren
- 🎮 Offers a visual Blockly-style builder (Rescript/Tauri)
- 🛰️ Injects CI/CD and dialectic logic via Robot-Repo-Automaton and Guix (with Nix fallback)

🧠 Philosophy

Scaffoldia is the Rosetta Stone of repo structure: symbolic and scalable; composable and narratable. 

Every folder and file has its vole.
