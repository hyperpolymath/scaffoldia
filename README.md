# 🧱 Scaffoldia

**Scaffoldia** is a dialectic, modular, and community-driven repo scaffolding engine. It helps developers, educators, and teams generate idiomatic, validated, and narratable project structures across languages, tools, and epistemic stances.

## 🔧 What It Does

- 🧠 Validates language/tool templates via a Haskell-powered registry
- 🧩 Composes repo scaffolds using Nickel
- 🧪 Infers missing structure with MiniKanren
- 🎮 Offers a visual Blockly-style builder (Svelte/Vite)
- 🛰️ Injects CI/CD and dialectic logic via SaltRover or Nix

## 🚀 Getting Started

cd scaffoldia
git init

🧠 Philosophy

Scaffoldia is the Rosetta Stone of repo structure: symbolic, composable, and narratable. Every folder has a role. Every tool has a dialect.
